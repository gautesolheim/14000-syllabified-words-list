# 14k-syllabized-word-list
This repo contains a list of 14 000 of the 20 000 most common English words,
divided into syllables.


The data is derived from two sources: A list of 180 000 syllabized words released under the public domain through Project Gutenberg, and a list of the 20 000 most common English words. The second list is derived from Peter Norvig's [n-gram analysis](http://norvig.com/ngrams/ "description") of Google Web Trillion Word Corpus.
