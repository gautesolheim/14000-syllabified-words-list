This repository contains a list of approximately 14 000 of the 20 000 most common English words,
divided into syllables.

The data is collected from two sources: A list of 180 000 syllabified words released to the public domain through Project Gutenberg, and a list of the most common English words derived from the *[Google Web Trillion Word Corpus](http://googleresearch.blogspot.no/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html)* by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/ngrams/).
